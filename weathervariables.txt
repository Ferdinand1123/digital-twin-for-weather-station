Sensors and Their Measurements:
bmp180_temp: Temperature measured by the BMP180 sensor (typically in degrees Celsius).
bmp180_pres: Atmospheric pressure measured by the BMP180 sensor (typically in Pascals or hectopascals).
bmp180_slp: Sea-level pressure calculated from the BMP180 sensor readings.
bmp180_alt: Altitude calculated from the BMP180 sensor readings based on the pressure data.
bmp280_temp: Temperature measured by the BMP280 sensor.
bmp280_pres: Atmospheric pressure measured by the BMP280 sensor.
bmp280_slp: Sea-level pressure calculated from the BMP280 sensor readings.
bmp280_alt: Altitude calculated from the BMP280 sensor readings.
bme_temp: Temperature measured by the BME280 sensor.
bme_pres: Atmospheric pressure measured by the BME280 sensor.
bme_slp: Sea-level pressure calculated from the BME280 sensor readings.
bme_alt: Altitude calculated from the BME280 sensor readings.
bme_hum: Humidity measured by the BME280 sensor (typically in percentage).
htu_temp: Temperature measured by the HTU21D sensor.
htu_hum: Humidity measured by the HTU21D sensor.
mcp9808: Temperature measured by the MCP9808 sensor.

Environmental and Weather Conditions:
tipping: Data from a tipping bucket rain gauge, which measures precipitation. This typically counts the number of tips, each representing a specific amount of rainfall.
vis_light: Visible light intensity measured by a light sensor (typically in lux).
ir_light: Infrared light intensity measured by a light sensor.
uv_light: Ultraviolet light intensity measured by a UV sensor (typically in UV index units).
wind_dir: Wind direction, often measured in degrees from north (0-360 degrees).
wind_speed: Wind speed, typically measured in meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h).
